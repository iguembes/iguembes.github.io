## About me

Hi! My name is Ivan Guembes, and I'm an Industrial engineer graduate from University of Lima, in Peru.
I'm a peruvian native but got moved with my family to Massachusetts, USA in 2018 and planning to live, study and work here for the near future. During my professional career in Peru I have performed supply chain related positions, the longest one in charge of the procurement department for a state owned company. 
I also have owned a small business related to supply personal protective equipment – PPE- for commercial and industrial customers.
Regarding my professional career here in USA, I have worked for 3M company in his manufacturing site located in Rockland, MA, as a Production Setup Technician, and then I got a position in Moderna, as a Logistics Associate, where I’m working now.
Currently learning an online Professional Certificate in Coding at MIT xPRO.

### Projects

As I mentioned above I’m currently working at Moderna, as a Logistics Associate, and one of the most needed processes required for biotech and pharma companies, is  cold chain management. 
Cold chain involves the transportation of temperature sensitive products along a supply chain through thermal and refrigerated packaging methods, ensuring products arrive on time, minimizing risks. 
Thinking on how to efficiently manage a cold chain system, I ended up registering myself in the Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development at MIT xPRO.
The reason I took this online certificate is because my personal project will be related with a cold chain temperature monitoring solution, that can use for example wireless sensors to measure and record real-time temperatures in a remote location, like a cold room or refrigerated container, and detect temperature changes, among other deviations. 
Since real-time temperature monitoring alerts can instantly warn you if the temperature has fluctuated below or above a predetermined threshold you can respond in the moment to mitigate any potential damage. That means allow to act before it’s too late. 
So far, I have been working hard in this new skill, but still I’m not able to show you some advance in the specific project I mentioned above but in my personal portfolio you will find some projects I did using the three main languages used to build websites are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and also developer tools such as GitHub, Visual Studio Code, Bootstrap, among others. 
I’ll update this personal portfolio regularly then you can see some advances in the next weeks.
Feel free to contact me thru the contact section if you have questions. I'm happy to share more about my personal project and any other topic you want to discuss with me.
Best wishes for you all!!!
